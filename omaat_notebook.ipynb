    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the mass analysis of thousands of spatially defined samples, and can be applied in the high-throughput screening of, for example, enzyme activity or compound libraries. Here we present OpenMSI Arrayed Analaysis Tools, an Python based software tool for the analysis of spatially defined samples with MSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial Notebook ([Tutorial_OpenMSI_Arrayed_Analysis_Tools](link to notebook in reposetory)) will demonstrate the basic features of OpenMSI Arrayed Analaysis Tools, with step by step guidance on how to run the Jupyter/iPython Notebook. A normal version, without the turtorial markdown, is also available ([OpenMSI_Arrayed_Analysis_Tools](link to notebook in reposetory)). Furthermore, a version showcasing advanced capabilities and no mardown is also available ([Advanced_OpenMSI_Arrayed_Analyis_Tools](link to notebook inreposetory). To complete this tutorial, one would need:\n",

    "<li>Jupyter/iPython. OpenMSI Arrayed Analaysis Tools requires Jupyter version 4.1+ and Python version 2.7+ or 3.2+. Further information on iPython/Jupyter can be found at and http://ipython.org/. </li>\n",
    "<li>The following Python packages:<ul>\n",

    "<li>future (for Python 2.7)</li>\n",
